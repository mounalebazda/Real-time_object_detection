# Title :

Real-time Object Detection System

# Description :

it is an object detection system designed to identify and classify objects in real-time using a webcam. Built on the powerful OpenCV library and leveraging the SSD MobileNet V3 model trained on the extensive COCO dataset, this application can detect multiple object types with high accuracy. With its efficient processing and high frame rate, RealVision is perfect for educational purposes, security systems, and interactive tech demonstrations.

# Technologies Used :

- OpenCV (cv2): Utilizes computer vision techniques and algorithms to process video input.
- SSD MobileNet V3: A fast and efficient deep learning model pre-trained on the COCO dataset for detecting objects.
- Python: The backbone scripting language that integrates OpenCV functionalities and handles all computational processes.
- COCO dataset: Common Objects in Context, a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset.
